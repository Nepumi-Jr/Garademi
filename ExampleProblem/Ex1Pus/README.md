# This is Examples about problem stucture or Task

## Ex1Plus
This is the simplest of all problem type

In this problem user must write a program that get `A` and `B` and display the sum of `A` and `B`

```
#input
    The first line contain integer number A (1 ≤ A ≤ 1000)
    The second line contain integer number B (1 ≤ A ≤ 1000)
#output
    print the result of A+B
```

Just create file `1.in` `1.sol` , `2.in` `2.sol`...(depend on how many testcase that you want)

example `1.in` is
```
12
7
```
`1.sol` is
```
19
```

In this problem type, Grader will judge by using `?.in` as input and compare between `user program's output` and `?.sol`

TIP : when it compare it will ignore `white spaces` and `new lines`
